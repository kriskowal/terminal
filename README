Herein are all of the bits and pieces for an HTML5-VT100
client, using a Node server and a Socket.IO client.

It does not presently work.  It was, at one time, able to
stream a telnet connection, particularly to the
ASCII Star Wars at towel.blinkenlights.nl.  It was never
good at sending user input into the terminal, and I've never
whitnessed the window sizing code affect the
pseudo-terminal.
